Requirements
  Keep Alive requires that your device has a lock screen and an active cellular plan.  WiFi calling and messaging will be used if the device supports it.

How it Works
  Keep Alive uses your device's lock screen to detect activity. If your device hasn't been lock or unlocked for a set period of time, you will be prompted with an 'Are you there?' notification. If this notification is not acknowledged an Alert will be triggered. Based on the configured Emergency Contact Settings, one or more SMS messages and/or a phone call will be placed to notify others that you may be in need of assistance.

Main Settings
* Hours of Inactivity Before Prompt - how many hours since your phone was last locked or unlocked before you are prompted with an 'Are you there?' notification. Defaults to 12 hours
* Minutes to Wait - if the prompt is not acknowledged within this time, an Alert will be sent based on the configured emergency contact settings. Defaults to 60 minutes

Emergency Contact Settings
* Phone Call Number (Optional) - when an Alert is triggered a phone call will be placed to this number with speakerphone enabled

One or more SMS recipients can be configured with:
* Phone Number - the phone number to send the Alert SMS to
* Alert Message - the message that will be sent when an Alert is triggered
* Include Location - if enabled, your location will be included in a second SMS
